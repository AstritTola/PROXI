# BFLP: Bag of Features for Link Prediction

This repository contains the code implementation for generating feature vectors used in link prediction tasks.

## Overview

In this repository, you'll find code for generating feature vectors using the Bag of Features (BFLP) method. The feature vectors are designed to facilitate link prediction tasks in various datasets.
Usage

- **General**: The codes in the General folder are tailored for processing datasets such as Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, Photo, Computers, Texas, Wisconsin, Chameleon, Squirrel, Crorcodile and OGBL-PPA. They provide a generalized approach for generating feature vectors applicable across different domains.
- **Collab**: The codes in the Collab folder are specifically designed for the ogbl-collab dataset. They are optimized for collaboration network analysis and provide specialized features for this dataset.
